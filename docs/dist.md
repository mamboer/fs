# Distribution

This utility is primarily distributed as an [npm
package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aotu~fs) (*simply `npm
install` and use it in your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
development environment*).

In addition, the [GitHub Releases
Page](https://github.com/o2team/fs/releases) contains a
tarball for each release (`fs_{ver}tar.gz`) ... which
promotes various executable bindings **and documentation** (*should
you wish to retain the docs locally*).  The tarball contains the
following executable bindings (**it's your choice**):

```
